## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/aathithiyan45/Potato-Classifier.git
cd Potato-Classifier
Create and activate a Python virtual environment:

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
Install required dependencies:
pip install torch torchvision timm pillow django

Dataset
Place your dataset in classifier/datasets/ with subfolders for each class.

python train_model.py

The trained model will be saved automatically at:
classifier/ml_models/potato_classifier.pth

Default training is 5 epochs (adjustable in train_model.py).

Usage
Start the Django server:

bash
Copy code
python manage.py runserver
Open your browser at:

cpp
Copy code

If you want, I can also **add badges** for Python version, PyTorch, and License so your README looks **more professional and portfolio-ready**.  

Do you want me to do that next?
